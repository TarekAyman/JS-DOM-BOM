### **Introduction to HTML DOM**

The **HTML DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and modify an HTML document. When a web page loads, the browser generates a structured representation of the page known as the **DOM tree**.

### **HTML DOM Structure**

The DOM represents an HTML document as a **tree of objects**, where each element in the document is a node in the tree. Using this model, JavaScript can dynamically manipulate the content and structure of a webpage.

### **What JavaScript Can Do with the HTML DOM**

With the HTML DOM, JavaScript has extensive control over a webpage, including:

- Modifying **HTML elements** (changing text, adding/removing elements, etc.).
    
- Altering **HTML attributes** (e.g., updating an image's `src` attribute).
    
- Modifying **CSS styles** dynamically.
    
- **Adding or removing** HTML elements and attributes.
    
- Handling and creating **events** (e.g., user interactions like clicks and key presses).
    

### **Key Concepts of the HTML DOM**

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard** that defines how documents should be accessed and manipulated. The standard ensures that different programming languages and browsers can interact with documents in a uniform way.

The W3C DOM standard consists of three parts:

1. **Core DOM** - A standard model for all document types.
    
2. **XML DOM** - A standard model for XML documents.
    
3. **HTML DOM** - A standard model for HTML documents.
    

### **Understanding the HTML DOM**

The **HTML DOM** serves as a structured way to work with HTML documents using JavaScript. It defines:

- **HTML elements as objects** (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>`, `<button>`, etc.).
    
- **Properties** for each HTML element (e.g., `innerHTML`, `className`, `id`).
    
- **Methods** to interact with HTML elements (`getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, etc.).
    
- **Events** that can trigger actions (`onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc.).
    

In summary, the HTML DOM provides a **standardized approach** to manipulating web pages dynamically. Mastering the DOM is essential for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

>In other words: **The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.**

### **What’s Next?**

In the following sections, we will explore:

- How to modify HTML content dynamically.
    
- How to change CSS styles using JavaScript.
    
- How to handle events in the DOM.
    
- How to add and remove HTML elements programmatically.
    

By understanding these concepts, you will be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications using JavaScript and the HTML DOM.
